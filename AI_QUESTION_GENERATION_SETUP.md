### Question Generation Process:
1. System queries your uploaded standards from database
2. Sends standard code + description to OpenAI
3. AI generates contextually appropriate questions
4. Questions are validated and formatted
5. Saved to database with proper metadata:
   - Subject
   - Grade level
   - Standard ID
   - Question type
   - Difficulty level
   - Correct answers
   - Explanations

## Database Tables

### `common_core_standards`
- Stores all your uploaded standards
- Fields: `id`, `code`, `subject`, `grade_level`, `description`

### `diagnostic_test_questions`
- Stores generated questions
- Fields: `id`, `subject`, `grade_level`, `standard_id`, `question_text`, `question_type`, `options`, `correct_answer`, `difficulty_level`, `skill_category`

## What Happens Next

When students take diagnostic tests:
1. System pulls questions from `diagnostic_test_questions`
2. Questions are filtered by grade level and subject
3. Adaptive algorithm adjusts difficulty based on performance
4. Results are mapped back to specific standards
5. Parents see which standards their child has mastered

## Advanced Features

### Batch Generation
- Questions are generated in batches of 5 to avoid timeouts
- Progress updates show each batch being created

### Difficulty Levels
- Easy (Level 1)
- Medium (Level 2)
- Hard (Level 3)
- Mixed automatically for comprehensive assessment

### Question Variety
- System rotates through different question types
- Ensures diverse assessment methods
- Aligns with standard's learning objectives

## Testing the System

1. **Generate Sample Questions:**
   - Go to Content tab
   - Select "Mathematics", "Grade 3"
   - Pick any standard from dropdown
   - Generate 5 questions to test

2. **View Generated Questions:**
   - Use the Question Bank Manager (also in Content tab)
   - Filter by subject/grade to see your questions
   - Edit or delete as needed

3. **Use in Diagnostic Tests:**
   - Questions automatically appear in student diagnostic tests
   - Filtered by appropriate grade level and subject

## Troubleshooting

### If questions aren't generating:
1. Check that OpenAI API key is configured in Supabase
2. Verify standards exist in database for selected grade/subject
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure you're selecting a standard before clicking generate

### If questions seem off-topic:
- The AI uses the exact standard description you uploaded
- Verify your standards data is accurate
- Try regenerating with different difficulty levels

## Next Steps

You're all set! You can now:
1. Generate questions for any standard you've uploaded
2. Build comprehensive diagnostic tests
3. Create targeted practice sessions
4. Track student mastery of specific standards

The system will automatically use these questions across:
- Diagnostic tests
- Practice sessions
- Adaptive learning paths
- Standards mastery tracking
