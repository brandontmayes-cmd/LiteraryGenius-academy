# Vercel Deployment Fix - 404 Error Resolution

## Issue
Deployment was returning `404: NOT_FOUND` error with ID: `cle1::qvl7q-1759714632010-bdf29d231e07`

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` configuration was missing explicit build settings that Vercel needs to properly build and serve a Vite + React application.

## Solution Applied

### Updated vercel.json with:
1. **Build Configuration**
   - `buildCommand`: "npm run build"
   - `outputDirectory`: "dist" (Vite's default output)
   - `framework`: "vite" (tells Vercel to use Vite optimizations)
   - `installCommand`: "npm install"

2. **Routing Configuration**
   - Maintained SPA rewrites to handle React Router
   - All routes redirect to `/index.html`

3. **Optimized Headers**
   - Service Worker caching headers
   - Asset caching (1 year for immutable assets)
   - Security headers (XSS, Frame Options, Content Type)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
   git commit -m "Fix: Add explicit Vercel build configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure build completes successfully
   - Test the deployed URL

## Expected Build Process

```
1. Install dependencies (npm install)
2. Run build command (npm run build)
3. Output to dist/ directory
4. Serve static files from dist/
5. Route all requests to index.html for SPA routing
```

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. **Check Build Logs** in Vercel dashboard for errors
2. **Verify Environment Variables** are set correctly in Vercel
3. **Clear Vercel Cache**: Settings â†’ Clear Cache and Redeploy
4. **Check Node Version**: Ensure Vercel uses Node 18+ (set in dashboard)

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Additional Notes

- The build output is in the `dist/` directory
- Vite automatically handles asset optimization
- Service Worker is configured with proper caching headers
- All security headers are maintained
