# üéØ How to Get Your Stripe Price IDs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Product ID vs Price ID

You provided **Product IDs** (starting with `prod_`), but the checkout system needs **Price IDs** (starting with `price_`).

### Your Products:
- **Basic ($19/month)**: `prod_TBlPB9UVSCIavx`
- **Premium ($29/month)**: `prod_TBlSyBBfJEVC27`
- **Enterprise ($49/month)**: `prod_TBlUmM1i05qqBF`
