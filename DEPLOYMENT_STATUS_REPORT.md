## 🔍 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Missing Stripe Edge Function
**Problem:** Your subscription system calls a Supabase Edge Function that doesn't exist:
- File: `src/components/SubscriptionPlans.tsx` (line 50)
- Calls: `stripe-subscription-manager`
- Status: **MISSING** ❌

**Impact:** Payment/subscription functionality will fail when users try to subscribe.

**Files Affected:**

- `src/components/SubscriptionManagement.tsx`

**Solution Needed:** Create the Stripe edge function in `supabase/functions/stripe-subscription-manager/`
